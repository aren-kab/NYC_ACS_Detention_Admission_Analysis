# NYC_ACS_Detention_Admission_Analysis
An analysis of the NYC detention admissions by community district. The goal here is to understand the distribution of detentions accross community groups and boroughs, including to map them for visual purposes. 

Each dataset is available via the NYC Open Data Portal: 
<br>
<a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Detention-Admissions-by-Community-District/2hrw-qfsu/about_data">Detention Admissions by Community District
</a>
  <br>

The approach in analysis of the notebook is as follows:

A) An analysis of the data by borough in totals and in context of population
<br>
B) Vizualising and Mapping the results by borough 
<br>
C) A look into community districts with the most detentions
